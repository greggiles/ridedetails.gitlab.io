## Monday Details

* **When**: We are planning to leave Brighton at 3PM to be there at 4PM ... Ride at ~4:15PM
* **Where**: Meet at this middle school down the road so that we don't have to pay for parking. 
* **What**: Probably 2 or 2.5 laps of Addison 


**Coach notes**: I have a seat or two that I can take a rider or two ... reach out. Otherwise, work on a car pool with teammates!!
